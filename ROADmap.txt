LicenPrep AI
"Adaptive Exam Generation & Mastery Analytics Platform"

1. Vision and Goals
Turn raw textbooks, lecture notes, and guidelines into blueprint-aligned exam questions (MCQs, flashcards, cloze) in seconds.

Adapt practice loops dynamically using Bayesian proficiency models and SM-2 spaced repetition.

Deliver real-time progress analytics mapped to USMLE and other licensing exam blueprints.

Enable faculty oversight: fast approve/flag AI-generated items.

Deploy efficiently from laptop POC ‚Üí cloud SaaS with minimal GPU cost.

2. Learner Journey

Step	Description
Ingest	Student/faculty drops a PDF or slide deck into the system
Generate	Fresh quiz appears automatically (MCQs, flashcards)
Practice	Adaptive learning loop adjusts difficulty/topics
Progress	Dashboards reveal weak areas mapped to blueprint topics
Faculty Oversight	Educators approve, flag, or edit AI-written content
3. Current Implementation Status

Layer	Status	Notes
Ingestion	‚úÖ MVP Ready	OCR fallback needs improvement
Embeddings & Vector DB	‚úÖ Operational	MiniLM+Chroma; OpenAI fallback pending
Retrieval	‚ùå Not built	k-NN + MMR planned
Question Generation	‚ùå Not built	DeepSeek/vLLM RAG flow pending
Validation Layer	‚ùå Not started	No self-consistency voting yet
Adaptive Engine	‚ùå Not started	No spaced repetition/IRT models yet
Analytics Service	‚ùå Not started	No dashboards or event capture yet
Faculty Review Tools	‚ùå Not started	No approve/flag UI yet
Cloud Deployment	üü° Partial scaffolding	Docker/Helm/KEDA WIP
4. Architecture Blueprint

Layer	Services/Tools
Frontend	React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Table
API Gateway	FastAPI (GraphQL/REST)
Domain Services	Ingestion, Embedding, Quiz Generation, Analytics
Vector DB	ChromaDB (local) / future: Pinecone/Qdrant
Persistence	SQLite (local) / future: Postgres + pgvector
LLMs	Local LLaMA-3 or GPT-4o (cloud option)
Infra	Docker Compose ‚Üí Helm ‚Üí Kubernetes (prod)
5. POC ‚Üí Production Roadmap

Phase	Milestone	Target Date
POC v0.1	Working ingestion + embedding; manual quiz testing	May 2025
POC v0.2	Add retrieval + generation prototype (small scale)	June 2025
POC v0.3	Basic human QA loop + blueprint tagging MVP	July 2025
Beta v0.5	End-to-end adaptive engine with basic dashboards	August 2025
Beta v0.6	Deploy to Fly.io / AWS Lightsail with KEDA autoscaling	September 2025
v1.0 Launch	Add Vision-based Q-gen, VisionOS mobile flashcards	Q4 2025
6. Key Success Metrics (POC Phase)

Goal	Metric
Question Quality	‚â•80% human-rated 4/5 or better
Latency	Ingest-to-quiz under 90 seconds
Blueprint Coverage	œá¬≤ mismatch < 5% against exam quotas
Cost Efficiency	<$0.25 per 100 generated questions
7. Key Risks and Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
Item Quality Hallucination	Add GPT-4o fact-checking later
Blueprint Drift	œá¬≤ coverage monitoring and rebalance
GPU Cost Explosion	Smart autoscaling with KEDA
Faculty Adoption	Build dead-simple approve/flag UI
8. Immediate Focus Areas
Finalize sample PDFs for ingestion (~200 pages).

Decide faculty approval flow (mandatory before learner release?).

Confirm GPT-4o usage budget and fallback thresholds.

Choose cloud target: Fly.io vs AWS vs bare-metal.
